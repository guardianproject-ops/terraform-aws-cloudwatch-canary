  Creates resources for a AWS Synthetics Canary

introduction: |-

  Note it is not possible
  ([yet](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/11145))
  to create AWS Synthetic Canaries via terraform.

  For now this module just creates the adjacent required resources. You'll need
  to create the canary in the UI and select the IAM Role and S3 bucket from this
  module.

# How to use this project
usage: |-

  ```hcl
  module "canary" {
    source = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-canary.git?ref=master"

    bucket_name = "my-cwsyn-bucket"
    canary_name = "my-canary"
    context     = module.this.context
  }
  ```
